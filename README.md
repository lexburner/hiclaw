# HiClaw

**Open-source Agent Teams system with IM-based multi-Agent collaboration and human-in-the-loop oversight.**

HiClaw lets you deploy a team of AI Agents that communicate via instant messaging (Matrix protocol), coordinate tasks through a centralized file system, and are fully observable and controllable by human administrators.

## Key Features

- **Agent Teams**: Manager Agent coordinates multiple Worker Agents to complete complex tasks
- **Human in the Loop**: All Agent communication happens in Matrix Rooms where humans can observe and intervene at any time
- **AI Gateway**: Unified LLM and MCP Server access through Higress, with per-Worker credential management
- **Stateless Workers**: Workers load all config from centralized storage -- destroy and recreate freely
- **MCP Integration**: External tools (GitHub, etc.) accessed via MCP Servers with centralized credential management
- **Open Source**: Built on Higress, Tuwunel, MinIO, OpenClaw, and Element Web

## Quick Start

See **[docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md)** for a step-by-step guide from zero to a working Agent team.

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine
- An LLM API key (e.g., Qwen, OpenAI)
- (Optional) A GitHub Personal Access Token for GitHub collaboration features

### 30-Second Overview

```bash
# Option A: Using Make (for developers)
git clone https://github.com/higress-group/hiclaw.git && cd hiclaw
HICLAW_LLM_API_KEY="sk-xxx" make install

# Option B: One-line install (no git clone needed)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/higress-group/hiclaw/main/install/hiclaw-install.sh | bash -s manager

# Then open Element Web and chat with your Manager Agent
# http://matrix-client-local.hiclaw.io:8080

# Or send tasks via CLI
make replay TASK="Create a Worker named alice for frontend development. Create it directly."
```

## Multi-Agent Architecture: HiClaw vs OpenClaw Native

HiClaw is built on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/nicepkg/openclaw) and extends it from a single-process multi-agent framework into a fully managed Agent Teams platform. The Manager Agent leverages the Higress AI Gateway to automate the entire multi-agent lifecycle -- from Worker creation and credential provisioning to task dispatch, progress monitoring, and skill evolution -- all through natural language conversation.

### 1. Deployment & Topology

| | OpenClaw Native | HiClaw |
|---|---|---|
| **Deployment** | Single process, all agents in one Gateway | Distributed containers, one per agent, cross-machine |
| **Topology** | Flat peers, channel-based routing | Hierarchical Manager + Workers |
| **Scaling & isolation** | Vertical; shared process, one crash affects all | Horizontal; container-level fault isolation |

### 2. Communication & Human Visibility

| | OpenClaw Native | HiClaw |
|---|---|---|
| **Channel** | Internal message bus | Matrix Rooms (IM protocol) |
| **Human visibility** | Optional | **Built-in** -- human is in every Room |
| **Agent-to-agent** | Opaque internal routing | All exchanges visible, searchable, interruptible |

Every Room contains Human + Manager + Worker. The human can intervene at any time -- guiding a Worker to improve task execution (feeding back into skill optimization), or coaching the Manager on better Worker management strategies (refining its management skills).

### 3. LLM & MCP Credential Management

| | OpenClaw Native | HiClaw |
|---|---|---|
| **LLM access** | Each agent holds its own API key | Unified AI Gateway with per-agent consumer tokens |
| **Tool credentials** | Each agent holds real credentials | Centralized at gateway -- agents never see real credentials |
| **Permission control** | Per-agent config | Manager grants/revokes MCP Server access per Worker |
| **Rotation** | Manual edit + restart | Automated dual-credential sliding window, zero downtime |

Workers only hold their own consumer tokens. Even a compromised Worker cannot access upstream API credentials.

### 4. Lifecycle & Skill Evolution Automation

| | OpenClaw Native | HiClaw |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent creation** | Manual config + restart | Conversational: _"Create a Worker named alice for frontend dev"_ |
| **Monitoring** | No cross-agent monitoring | Manager heartbeat in Rooms (human-visible) |
| **Config updates** | Edit files + restart | Hot-reload, seconds to take effect |
| **Self-improvement** | None | Manager reviews performance, evolves team skills |

The Manager handles the full Worker lifecycle autonomously: account registration, SOUL.md generation, credential provisioning, skill assignment, task dispatch, and heartbeat monitoring. Two built-in extension mechanisms drive continuous improvement:

- **Worker Experience Management**: per-Worker performance profiles with skill-level scoring, used for intelligent task assignment.
- **Skill Evolution Management**: pattern recognition across tasks, new skill drafting, human review, and simulated task validation.

## Build & Test

```bash
# Build all images
make build

# Build + run all integration tests (10 test cases)
make test

# Run specific tests only
make test TEST_FILTER="01 02 03"
